# react-coding-challenge

App is availabe for preview at https://react-coding-challenge-seven.vercel.app/

This project was made with as little dependencies as possible.
No prettier, linting, css frameworks

Please note:
Since we don't have photoshop source files, font sizes, colors and spacing were approximated for mobile, tablet and desktop. Tool used was https://www.photopea.com/

Mobile first approach was used for css and media queries used are listed below:
Mobile / Tablet 0 - 768px
Desktop 769px and beyond

## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

- Mobile first for css, I find it a lot easier to maintain.
- The folder structure is pretty basic, all components inside their own folder so they're grouped.
- I also added a layout just to factor our the header and footer from the rest, that'll make them reusable for other pages for scaling.
- CSS was as plain as it can/should be

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- The images are huge, I had no control of it.
- Add code quality helpers - prettier & eslint
- Some animation when cards are hovered
- The appstore buttons doesn't look too pretty in mobile

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

- I couldve made the mobile menu/hambuer work
- The cards for shows could be more responsive, instead of just bumping the cards down to the next line
- TDD
- Refactor constants
- Refactor css, use BEM
